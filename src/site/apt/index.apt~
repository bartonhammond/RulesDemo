	Rule Runner Demo
	
	You are being asked to code a simple rules engine demo that performs the following
	tasks:
	
	Accept a series of integers as command-line arguments
	Run a set of rules against the integers
	For each rule, output to standard out a passed or failed message
	If all rules pass, output to standard out a message saying all rules passed
	
	Eventually, this system is planned to evolve to more complex rules, but the initial set of
	rules are very simple:
	
	Rule A : If any two sequential integers in the sequence add up to 1000 or greater, the
	rule is "passed". If not, the rule is "failed".
	
	Rule B : If any integer in the sequence is at least 500 greater than the one previous to it
	in the sequence, the rule is "passed", else it is "failed".
	
	Rule C : If the average of all the integers in the sequence is 500 or greater, the rule
	is "passed", else it is "failed".
	
	Notes:
	
	You will implement these three rules as part of this demo, but keep in mind that
	additional rules may be added later. You may accept it as a given that rules do not
	reference each other, each rule stands on its own. The order that the rules run in is
	unimportant as long as all of them run.
	
	For the purposes of this demo, you don't need to provide any namespace for your
	classes, they may all go in the default package.
	
	No unit tests are required for this demo.
	
	You may use any IDE, editor, compiler or combination you like, but all code must be in
	Java (Java 1.4 or later). Feel free to use any JavaDocs, web resources, books or other
	tools or information sources that will help you complete the task more quickly.
	
	Example use of RuleRunner:
	
	user$ java RuleRunner 100 50 30 50 60 20 5000
	
	Rule RuleC passed.
	
	Rule RuleB passed.
	
	Rule RuleA passed.
	
	ALL rules passed.
	
	user$:
	
	Hints:
	
	If you need more than a total of 300 lines of code to implement this, you are thinking
	too hard or going overboard in some fashion. Likewise, if you need fewer than 50 lines
	you may not be using best practices. Don't, for example, go nuts and implement a
	Domain Specific Language for the rules. Keep it simple and direct, while following best
	practices as you see them.
	
	Good Luck!
